    "We will study the same Vote 2002 voter mobilization campaign from last lab. Facing the 2002 midterm election and fearing another low turnout, civic groups in Iowa and Michigan launched the Vote 2002 campaign to boost voter turnout. In the week prior to the election, Vote 2002 volunteers placed phone calls to 60,000 voters and gave them the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Hello, may I speak with [name of person] please? Hi. This is [caller's name] calling from Vote 2002, a nonpartisan effort working to encourage citizens to vote. We just wanted to remind you that elections are being held this Tuesday. The success of our democracy depends on whether we exercise our right to vote or not, so we hope you'll come out and vote this Tuesday. Can I count on you to vote next Tuesday?‚Äù*\n",
