    "Crepon et al. (2013) study a large-scale, privately-run job seeker assistance program targeted at young, educated job seekers in France. Under the program, private agencies are contracted to provide intensive placement services to young graduates (with at least a two-year college degree) who have been unemployed for at least six months. To incentivize agency performance, private providers are paid a bonus if a job seeker they assist finds a job with a contract of at least six months and stays employed for at least six months.\n",

    "The researchers study the assistance program using a randomized experiment. The experiment covers about 30,000 job seekers in 235 cities. Job seekers typically look for jobs in the city they live in. Job seekers assigned to the treatment are offered the opportunity to enroll in the privately-run job placement program. Control job seekers cannot enroll in the job placement program, but still have access to the French public employment agency, which is thought to provide less intensive placement services. Existing evidence suggests that the private job placement program will improve the labor market outcomes of participants.\n",

   "source": [
    "**(25 points)** In Lab 2, we discovered an **attrition** problem in the Ctrip experiment. We wanted to measure the causal effect of Work From Home on worker productivity, and found that control group employees were more likely than treatment group employees to leave the company by the end of the experiment. This presents a problem because, while randomization guarantees that the treatment and control groups are comparable at the *beginning of the experiment*, attrition breaks this guarantee so that by the *end of the experiment* the treatment and control employees that remain may no longer be comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will apply the **trimming** method to estimating treatment effects in the presence of attrition. Under a few additional assumptions, trimming allows us to put bounds on the average treatment effect for a subset of the population. That is, we will be able to say this average treatment effect is no larger (more positive) than some **upper bound**, and no smaller (more negative) than some **lower bound**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption we will make is that, for any given employee, the treatment can only *increase* the chances that an employee stays at the company. This assumption is untestable; while we know from Lab 2 that the treatment increases the chances than an employee stays at the company *on average*, we do not know whether this is true *for every employee individually*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this assumption, there are **three** types of employees that begin in the experiment: those that will stay at the company regardless of whether they are assigned to the treatment or control group (**'Always-Stayers'**); those that will leave the company regardless (**‘Always-Leavers’**); and those that will only stay at the company if they are assigned to the treatment group (**‘If-Treated-Stayers’**). \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way we’ve defined these groups, we know that the control group contains only Always-Stayers by the end of the experiment. That's because the Always-Leavers and If-Treated-Stayers have left the company. By contrast, the treatment group contains both Always-Stayers and If-Treated-Stayers by the end of the experiment. Attrition introduces bias because treatment versus control comparisons are no longer comparing like with like; in particular, the treatment group includes If-Treated-Stayers and the control group does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of trimming is that, if we can remove the If-Treated-Stayers from our treatment group, then only Always-Stayers remain in both the treatment and control groups. That would *solve* the attrition problem. Once we've removed the If-Treated-Stayers, the comparison of the treatment and control groups provides an estimate of the average treatment effect among Always-Stayers. *The problem is, we do not know which employee is an If-Treated-Stayer.* This is the fundamental problem of causal inference all over again; we know whether a treatment or control employee leaves the company or not, but we do not know what *would have happened* if they were assigned to the other group.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can calculate bounds on the average treatment effect for Always-Stayers by considering **best case** and **worst case**  scenarios for which treatment group employees are the If-Treated-Stayers. In the **best case** scenario, we assume the *least productive* treatment group employees that stay at the company are the If-Treated-Stayers. This is the best case because removing the lowest performers from the treatment group will *increase* average productivity in the (remaining) treatment group and hence make the treatment group look even better compared to the control group. Removing these employees from the treatment group and comparing the modified treatment group to the control group provides an **upper bound** on the average treatment effect for  Always-Stayers. For the **worst case** scenario, we assume the *most productive* treatment group employees that stay at the company are the If-Treated-Stayers, and remove them from the data. Comparing the modified treatment group to the control group provides a **lower bound** on the average treatment effect for  Always-Stayers.\n",

The measure is scaled to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 across employees. That is, a one unit increase in `performance` coincides with a one standard deviation increase in productivity.
