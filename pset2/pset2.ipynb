    "**(20 points)** In this question we analyze the World Management Survey, a survey of management practices at firms across the world. There are dramatic differences in productivity across countries and across companies *within* countries. The quality of management is thought to be one important driver. But historically, we have not had good measures of management quality. The World Management Survey helps to fill this void.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey is designed in collaboration with McKinsey, a leading management consulting firm. In the survey, firms are evaluated based on 18 basic management practices. Each firm is scored on how their practices compare to what management consulting firms commonly understand as \"best practices.\" The survey focuses on measuring management practices along three operations-focused dimensions: (1) performance monitoring, (2) target setting, and (3) incentives/people management.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **monitoring**: how well do organizations monitor what goes on inside the firm, and use this information for continuous improvement? \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, **targets**: do organizations set the right targets, track the right outcomes, and take appropriate action if the two are inconsistent? \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, **incentives**: are organizations promoting and rewarding employees based on performance, prioritizing hiring, and trying to keep their best employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers use an open-ended telephone survey to assess firms on these dimensions. The process is described in more detail in this excerpt from a [background paper](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.1.203) on the survey:\n",
    "\n",
    "*To [score firms], we used open questions in the survey. For example, on the first monitoring dimension, we start by asking the open question “tell me how you monitor your production process,” rather than closed questions such as “do you monitor your production daily [yes/no].” We continue with open questions focusing on actual practices and examples until the interviewer can make an accurate assessment of the firm’s practices. For example, the second question on that monitoring dimension is “What kinds of measures would you use to track performance?” and the third is “If I walked round your factory what could I tell about how each person was performing?” The combined responses to this dimension are scored against a grid which goes from 1 (out of 5), which is defined as “**Measures tracked do not indicate directly if overall business objectives are being met. Tracking is an ad-hoc process (certain processes aren’t tracked at all)**,” up to 5 which is defined as “**Performance is continuously tracked and communicated, both formally and informally, to all staff using a range of visual management tools.**”*\n",
