    "\n",
    "Ctrip is considering allowing their call center employees to Work From Home (WFH). Allowing employees to WFH will reduce office expenses and potentially increase employee retention by making Ctrip a more attractive place to work. However, Ctrip is worried that employees may not work as hard at home, reducing productivity. To better understand what impact this policy has on productivity, Ctrip decides to run a randomized experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site for the experiment is Ctrip's airfare and hotel departments in Shanghai. These departments take calls from customers and make bookings. Employees typically work 5 shifts a week in teams of about 15 people, plus a manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recruit participants in the experiment, Ctrip asks 996 employees if they want to work from home 4 days a week. 508 volunteered. To participate in the experiment, Ctrip also requires that an employee meet additional requirements, including having their own room, broadband internet, and 6+ months of experience in the position. The final experiment group consists of 255 employees.\n",

This might reflect that the experiment happened to coincide with a down period for the company. By contrast, `peformance` in the treatment group is mostly unchanged.\n",

Perhaps rather than having a *positive* effect on employees in the treatment group, the experiment actually had a *negative* effect on employees in the control group. The fact that some employees were allowed to work from home may have made office workers *less productive.* This would be an example of *interference*. The outcomes of some employees are affected by the treatment status of *other* employees. This complicates our interpretation of the experiment results. The difference in productivity between the treatment and control groups no longer reflects the *causal effect of WFH* per se. It's now a combination of the causal effect of WFH and the potentially negative spillover effects from having co-workers that WFH.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons to think this kind of interference may be an issue. First, the lottery results may have had a negative effect on the morale of employees that lost the lottery. This decline in morale may have reduced productivity in the control group. Second, the experiment may have been disruptive to operations in the Shanghai office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are two other groups of employees that can help us identify whether interference is an issue. These two groups of employees will serve as an extra set of 'control' groups. They are not subject to the potential interference issues described above. If we see large reductions in productivity for these employees, similar to what we see in the control group, that would strongly suggest the reduction is not due to inteference. However, if we see no change in productivity for these groups (or even an increase), that would suggest interference is an important issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first group (with `expgroup = 2`) consists of employees in the same Shanghai office that did not originally volunteer to participate in the experiment, but would have been eligible to participate. This group should help with evaluating the first concern, since these employees did not participate in the lottery and so should not feel as though they 'lost' anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second group (with `expgroup = 3`) refers to employees in a second call center in Nan Tong who also would have met the eligibility criteria. These employees are doing the same work as the Shanghai office employees, but would not experienced any potential disruption that the WFH experiment caused for the Shanghai office.\n",
