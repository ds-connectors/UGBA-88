    "**(19 points)** In this question, we study an experiment conducted by Steve Levitt, an economist you may know from his [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/) book series and film.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our lives, we face many difficult decisions that have potentially far-reaching consequences for our well-being: for example, whether to quit a job, end a relationship, or move across the country. Often we are quite uncertain about what to do. Levitt's research question is this: do we make good choices when facing such important decisions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an ambitious question to answer. In the 'ideal' experiment for answering this question we would take a sample of people unsure about a major life decision; say, for example, whether to quit their job. Then we would *randomize* which decision they actually make and compare measures of well-being. From this hypothetical experiment we could measure the causal effect of quitting your job (for example) on well-being among those considering that decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, running an experiment like this is impossible in practice -- we cannot force people to quit their job or end a relationship, so even if we randomly *assign* participants to make a particular choice, there is a clear noncompliance problem. Participants can ultimately decide as they please. However, from the tools we developed in class, we can potentially deal with noncompliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Levitt's experiment worked: each participant in the experiment has stated that they are having a difficult time making an important life decision. (*I've included the list of major decisions that were included in the study below.*) Each decision has two choices: an 'active choice' (e.g., quit the job) and a 'status quo' choice (don't quit the job). Then, for each participant, *a coin is flipped*. One choice is assigned to 'heads' and the other choice is assigned to 'tails'. The outcome of the coin toss is randomized and the participant is shown the outcome of the coin toss. If the coin toss dictates that the participant make a change, participants were encouraged to make that change within two months. If the coin toss dictates that the participant maintain the status quo, participants were told to maintain the status quo for at least the next two months. In this sense, participants are randomly 'assigned' to make one choice or another. (Remarkably, as you'll see below, some participants actually follow what the coin dictates.) Six months after the coin toss, participants are surveyed on: (1) what choice they ultimately made and (2) how happy they are. About 3,000 participants facing important life decisions complete this survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happiness is measured on a 10-point scale. For reference, the standard deviation for a participant's *change* in happiness over 6 months is about 2.5 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the *outcome of interest* is reported happiness. The *treatment of interest* is an indicator for making the active choice (e.g. quit the job). And the *instrument* is an indicator for whether the coin toss dictates an active choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You won't need to read this list to answer the questions below, but for reference, these are the important life decisions that are included in the study:*\n",
    " * Should I quit my job?\n",
    " * Should I end a relationship?\n",
    " * Should I go back to school?\n",
    " * Should I start my own business?\n",
    " * Should I move?\n",
    " * Should I quit smoking?\n",
