    "Fearing another low turnout in the 2002 midterm elections, civic groups in Iowa and Michigan launched the Vote 2002 Campaign to boost voter turnout. In the week prior to the election, Vote 2002 volunteers called 60,000 voters on the phone and gave them the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Hello, may I speak with [name of person] please? Hi. This is [caller's name] calling from Vote 2002, a nonpartisan effort working to encourage citizens to vote. We just wanted to remind you that elections are being held this Tuesday. The success of our democracy depends on whether we exercise our right to vote or not, so we hope you'll come out and vote this Tuesday. Can I count on you to vote next Tuesday?‚Äù*\n",

For our causal effect estimate to be accurate, the comparison group we use will need to reflect the *counterfactual* outcomes for contacted voters: what those voters *would have* done if they had not received the Vote 2002 call. If the comparison group poorly represents the counterfactual, our estimate will be biased.\n",
